# ARMCA5, ARMCA7 and ARMCA9 are not configured
# with Neon in the pack. 
# And the standard .cmake in CMSIS Build tools
# is not supporting Cortex-A yet.
# Since the goal is to run the Neon code of CMSIS-DSP,
# we have added Cortex-A support to the .cmake
# and forced Neon support without taking into account
# the FPU variable from the pack.
# If you want to build those targets, you'll have to add
# Cortex-A support to the .cmake of CMSIS Build tools
# in the same way (forcing Neon)
#
# Also, the packs have an issue with the scatter file for gcc
# with is categorized as "Other" instead of "linkerScript"
# in CMSIS 5.9.0
# You'll need a more recent version where the problem 
# is solved
