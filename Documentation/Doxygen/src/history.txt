    * Create arm_mat_init_q7 (#235)
    * Improve float representation accuracy by increasing precision from 8 to 9 decimal digits (#226)
    * Correct issue #217 : vector type issues when targeting Helium
    * Internal rework of lots of files to be able to build Neon versions when targetting Cortex-A (it should not impact Cortex-M and Cortex-A not covered with the pack)
    * Other changes in the github repository : Cortex-A build with Neon using cmake and Zephyr module

    v1.15.0
    
    * Switched to semantic versioning
    * Corrections to MFCC
    * Updated support for cmsis build tools 2.0
    * Compute graph removed. It is now part of CMSIS-Stream
    * Github issues:
      * 95,96,105,106,108,111,112
    * New FFT initializations to allow linker to do code size optimizations
      * If you know the size of the transform at build time, prefer functions like
        arm_cfft_init_64_q15 to functions like arm_cfft_init_q15.
        It applies for CFFT, RFFT and MFCC and other datatypes.
