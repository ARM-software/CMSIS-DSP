    v1.15.0
    
    * Switched to semantic versioning
    * Corrections to MFCC
    * Updated support for cmsis build tools 2.0
    * Compute graph removed. It is now part of CMSIS-Stream
    * Github issues:
      * 95,96,105,106,108,111,112
    * New FFT initializations to allow linker to do code size optimizations
      * If you know the size of the transform at build time, prefer functions like
        arm_cfft_init_64_q15 to functions like arm_cfft_init_q15.
        It applies for CFFT, RFFT and MFCC and other datatypes.
